I am a Full-stack Engineer at Roomorama.com, where codes are written in between foosball games.

My current obsession is Ruby, soccer and badminton.

Python's scipy and scikit-learn are beckoning at me though, as I am entertaining my new interest in forex price modelling for algorithm trading.

Would love to get in touch and discuss any thing related to programming, religion or statistical modeling. Or anything else.
