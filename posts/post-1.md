This is yet another blog that I shall promise myself to keep. This one will talk about the projects and cool and uncool things that I've done.

I saw a friend's [super cool blog](http://yangshun.im/cs3216/#/) and after a few minutes of picking around I found his little python-based page generators for blogs, [luna](https://github.com/yangshun/luna). I just lost all the excuses to delay this. Mainly because I just wanted to try out this 'blogging engin'.

Seems pretty cool! Because of this I had to install a LAMP stack and run on localhost to preview every edit, but it's a one time set up and now I can blog in markdown(for which I need to refer to [the cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).

Let's get some shit done!
