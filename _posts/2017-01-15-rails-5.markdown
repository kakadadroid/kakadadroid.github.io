Rails 5 has been out for a while now, but I only recently found a chance to try it out.

I did a simple rails application and deployed on [Heroku](https://pocketurl.herokuapp.com/).

It didn't make use of the Rails 5 new features though: [ActionCable](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable), API mode, etc.

But this was a fun short project to brush up TDD.

See [source code here](https://github.com/keang/pocketurl).
