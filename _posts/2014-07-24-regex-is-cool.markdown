A few different projects called for the use of regex and until now, I still let go of a smile in amazement as I construct each regex query.

A online tool that is super useful is [Regex 101](http://regex101.com/), where different flavour of regex is accessible at a toggle. There is also an **Explanation** box that breaks down the qurey that I just constructed by trial and error.

While it's extremely useful and fulfilling, I still could not find enough reason and opportunity to learn regex proper. Just like many other things.

**A cool app idea:**  Take a test string, and the desired matching part, and outputs the regex expression.
