In last month's Singapore Ruby Meetup, I had the opportunity to share about PEG and DSL, something that I learnt while implementing a rules feature at Pocketmath. It was
my first talk and definitely will not be my last! See [the talk here.](goo.gl/xsiwmF) And [the slides here](https://goo.gl/o8UVag).
